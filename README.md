Song Recommendation Machine Learning Model
This repository contains files related to a song recommendation machine learning model. The model is designed to predict songs that users might enjoy based on their past listening preferences.

Overview
The machine learning model uses a collaborative filtering algorithm to analyze user behavior and preferences. It recommends songs by finding patterns in the listening habits of users with similar tastes. The model is trained on a dataset of user-song interactions and learns to make predictions based on this data.
